        <p>Hi there! </p>
        <p>I am Juanita P. Aguilera, a mom and wife from Rancagua, Chile.</p>
        <p>For the past 34 years, I've been a proud member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Currently, I serve as an ordinance worker at the temple in Santiago, Chile.</p>
        <p>I have three wonderful kids. In February, my two older children will embark on a mission. Meanwhile, I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology BS, starting with my AA, and I absolutely love the learning process.</p>
        <p>Although I am a professional in Psychology, I am now seeking a new and exciting path in the world of technology.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite quotes is by Dieter F. Uchtdorf: "None of us can or should move the Lord's work alone. But if we all stand close together in the place the Lord has appointed and lift where we stand, nothing can keep this divine work from moving upward and forward."</p>
        <p>I am grateful for the opportunity BYU has given me to accomplish my goals. On this journey, I know that I am not alone.</p>
