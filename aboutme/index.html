   <p>Hi there!I am a mom and wife.I am from Rancagua, Chile.</p>
   <p>Have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 34 years!
   <p>Now I am serving as an ordinance worker at the temple in Santiago, Chile.</p> 
   <p>I have three kids. My two older children will go on a mission in February.</p>
   <p>I decided to study Applied Technology BS. I am beginning my AA and really like this. I like studying.</p>
   <p>I am a professional in Psychology but I want a new path.</p>
   <p>My favorite quote is "none of us can or should move the Lord's work alone. 
      But if we all stand close together in the place the Lord has appointed and lift where we stand,</p>
   <p>nothing can keep this divine work from moving upward and forward"(Dieter F. Uchtdorf).</p> 
   <p>I am glad because BYU gives me the opportunity to accomplish my goals.</p>
   <p>I know that I am not alone on this path.</p>
