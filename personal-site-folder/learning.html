        <div class="learning1">
           <p >
            Whether you want to become a professional carpenter or simply build items for personal use, 
            learning carpentry skills is the first step.
            </p> 
            <p> Start by building up foundational skills and 
            learning how to use hand and power tools. For a more in-depth approach, take some courses in 
            carpentry or even earn a degree.
            </p>
            <p> To gain relevant experience, volunteer for a building organization, 
            work on a construction crew, or become a carpenter´s apprentice.
            </p> 
             
        </div>
        <div class="learning-paragraph1">
            <p> 
            Remember that carpentry is physically demanding work and always take the necessary precautions to keep yourself, and those 
            around you, safe Read books and trade journals about carpentry.
            </p>

        <div class="learning2">   
            <p>
                Become familiar with hand and power tools. 
                Carpenters use a variety of tools to manipulate wood but measuring tapes, squares, 
                and levels are essential for nearly every project. Practice using a hammer, drill, 
                nail gun, wood plane, and chisel as well.
            
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, learn how to use a variety of saws (such as a hand saw, table saw, circular saw, band 
                saw, and coping saw) so you can cut wood to any specification.   
            </p>

        <div class="learning-paragraph2" >
            <p> 
            If you’re new to carpentry, reading books, magazines, and journal articles can introduce you to the subject and teach you about basic skills as well as new 
            industry developments.
            </p> 
            <p>Search online or visit your local library to find relevant 
                publications. It also helps to read about architecture, especially if it covers the classical tradition.
                Depending on your school, the class might be called “shop,” “woodworking,” “fundamentals of 
                construction,” or “carpentry basics.”
                You will need a high school diploma or GED to become a professional carpenter.
            </p>
            <p>     
                You might even learn how to read building plans! Not only will you gain 
                valuable skills, but this can also help you decide if carpentry is a career path you want to explore.
