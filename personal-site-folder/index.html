                Carpenters one of construction’s most iconic roles. 
                Carpenters are involved throughout the building 
                process, from basic layout to the finishing touches on a home, school or office.
                </p>
                <p >
                A career as a carpenter is a great 
                option for people who are creative, detail-oriented and looking for exciting opportunities.
                One of the top reasons careers in the skilled trades like carpentry have high job satisfaction is the 
                opportunity to do hands-on work.

                <p >
                For many people, the idea of sitting at a desk in a cubicle staring at a computer screen or doing paperwork isn’t an ideal way to earn a living.
                Carpenters and other craft professionals, however, get to build and create something with their own hands. Every project and every day is unique, 
                so the work is less monotonous than in other career paths.
