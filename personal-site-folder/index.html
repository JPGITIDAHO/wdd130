                Carpenters one of construction’s most iconic roles. 
                Carpenters are involved throughout the building 
                process, from basic layout to the finishing touches on a home, school or office.

                For many people, the idea of sitting at a desk in a cubicle staring at a computer screen or doing paperwork isn’t an ideal way to earn a living.
                Carpenters and other craft professionals, however, get to build and create something with their own hands. Every project and every day is unique, so the work is less monotonous than in other career paths.
