            INTRODUCTION
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-1">
            Genshin Impact is an action RPG (Action Role-Playing Game). At the
            beginning of the game, you can choose between a boy and a girl to be
            the main character (they are twins), the twin you didn't select is
            captured by an uncertain kind of goddess, after that, you wake up
            into an unknown world named Teyvat in which the people can control
            elements if they have a "Vision" that is a gift from one of the
            seven archons that rule this world. You will be able to control the
            elements without a vision and that is super uncommon. All of your
            adventures go around in looking for your lost sibling, you will meet
            a lot of people that will help you recollect hints of the parade of
            your sibling and at the same time, you will help them in their
            problems.

            BASIC INFORMATION
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">
            Into the game, you will control elements, those elements are Pyro
            (Fire), Geo (Earth), Dendro (Nature), Cryo (Ice), Electro
            (Lightning), Anemo (Wind), and Hydro (Water). Another thing we need
            to keep in our minds is that with the elements that the characters
            control we can do elemental reactions. We need to understand that
            your characters and the enemies in the game can have these elements
            as a handicap, if one of your characters is affected by Hydro
            (Water) and then an enemy hits you with fire it will trigger the
            reaction "vaporize" and it will deal you more damage than only be
            hit by fire, the same applies for the enemies and we can use all of
            the different elements to do these reactions. The main character at
            first will be an Anemo (Wind) user. All the characters will use a
            type of weapon, the weapons are Sword, Bow, Polearm (Lance),
            Claymore (Two-handed sword), and Catalyst (Books of mage),
            characters can only use one. (SunMilk is the creator of the next image).
