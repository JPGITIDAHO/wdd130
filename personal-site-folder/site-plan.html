      Carpenters build frameworks and structures by cutting and shaping wood and other construction materials. One of construction’s most iconic roles, carpenters are involved throughout the building process, from basic layout to the finishing touches on a home, school or office.
      With skilled trades careers having a high job satisfaction rating, a career as a carpenter is a great option for people who are creative, detail-oriented and looking for exciting opportunities.
      One of the top reasons careers in the skilled trades like carpentry have high job satisfaction is the opportunity to do hands-on work.
      </p>
      <p>For many people, the idea of sitting at a desk in a cubicle staring at a computer screen or doing paperwork isn’t an ideal way to earn a living.
      Carpenters and other craft professionals, however, get to build and create something with their own hands. Every project and every day is unique, so the work is less monotonous than in other career paths.
      Working with their hands and being able to see the real-time progress and fruits of their labor makes construction an enjoyable and fulfilling job for carpenters.
      </p>
      <p>Because of the high demand for skilled carpenters and other craft professionals, these careers offer ample opportunities, more job security and enhanced benefits. Good carpenters should always be able to find good work in the current market.
      Everyone wants to leave their impact on the world. A career in carpentry offers a chance to make a difference in the lives of other people.
      The projects you might work on for only a few months could stand for the next 100 years or more. You could have a small but significant part to play in people’s happiest memories or most important events. Talk about leaving a legacy!
      Carpentry is a great job and a worthy career option.

      <h3>Learning  </h3>
      <p>
        Learning will be from scratch. I will talk about the nature of carpentry. I will include basic carpentry 
        concepts. The different types of wood and how to differentiate them. I'll start with questions and answers
        about what tools and materials I should have. How to create my workspace. How to organize my workshop. 
        Since there are several types of wood that can be learned to use, in this section we will show how to 
        use two of them. Hardwood will be the material we will use for our first project. The project that I will
        include will be how to make a meat chopping board.

        <img src="images/original.jpg" alt="image for page">

      <h3>Design</h3>  
      <p>The first part will indicate what types of hardwood can be obtained and what are the basic dimensions 
        that must be met for the project. This is for starters, you can always include your own imagination as 
        long as you stick to the basic rules. They will then need to gather the necessary materials and tools 
        for this project. It will tell you what they are since although it is a simple project, specific materials
         are required to do it correctly. I will include a list.
        The second part of the project will be the preparation that will be divided into 8 steps with images 
        and texts.
        The third part will include the realization of the project in 8 steps, we will see how we have to finish.
        The second option is in melamine chipboard. This type of material is much easier to start and finish as 
        it requires fewer processes in its treatment. This means that since the material comes with a ready-made 
        finishing process, only cutting and finishing steps are required in the assembly, unlike rustic wood. 
        This project will be like making a nightstand and include a drawer. The project will be shown step by 
        step in this type of material.
        The first part will be to design and choose the color. I will include a link to design in a specialized 
        software the dimensioning of this material, the program is called Polyboard. The second part will include
        the breakdown of this project.
        The third part will include the preparation of the material before assembly. Then we will go to the 
        assembly and finally to the completion including optional details.</p>

      <p>
      This section will include hints and tips to help small businesses thrive. We may be the most competent 
      accountants, resume writers, or artisan bakers in the world, but your small business will eventually 
      suffer if it lacks business sense. Starting your own small business is an exercise in uncertainty, which 
      is why it's so important to learn from those who have been in your shoes. With the right guidance, you 
      will be successful in creating a unique business. You'll run into roadblocks that can threaten business 
      viability if you overlook critical administrative tasks like bookkeeping or maintaining high-quality 
      supplier relationships. In fact, the top reasons a new business fails include lacking a marketing strategy, 
      not having a plan for how to scale the business to meet growing demand, or offering a poorly conceived 
      product or service with a total addressable market (TAM). ) too small.
      Here we will learn financial and marketing tips, as well as tips to maintain a good relationship with 
      your employees.
