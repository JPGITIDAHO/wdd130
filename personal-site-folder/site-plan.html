      <h3>To giving a welcome</h3>
      <p>
      The people who will visit our page will access information and motivation to start a design project 
      or acquire notions to improve or start their micro-enterprise. We all at some point have the desire 
      to create something but we don't know how to do it. One of the reasons why this page may be more 
      visited than others is that my page is a page of free services that are usually found on the web but 
      are paid. The basic information that will be required is an email to later be able to follow up and 
      encourage them to continue with the progress within the page. In addition to giving them a welcome, 
      it will motivate them to be self-sufficient. Another reason for this course is that currently, the 
      work of the carpenter is recognized as essential for the construction industry. His experience and 
      talent allow him to cover a number of different areas, including proper foundation positioning, new 
      stair placement, joist installation, trim, decorations, and more.
      The questions that my page will basically answer are what is it like to be a carpenter, what and what 
      are the types of wood, and how to start and design your projects in two types of wood. I will show 
      in a simple way what are the necessary tools and what basic skills those who want to start should have.
      We will also include tips and basic information for managing microenterprise resources that are not 
      freely available on most web pages. This section will answer essential questions about the proper 
      functioning of a microenterprise, be it financial, as well as the good treatment of employees if 
      they have any. Some of the questions we will answer will be what are the first steps and tips to improve
      your small business

      <h3>Learning and Design</h3>
      <p>
        Learning will be from scratch. I will talk about the nature of carpentry. I will include basic carpentry 
        concepts. The different types of wood and how to differentiate them. I'll start with questions and answers
        about what tools and materials I should have. How to create my workspace. How to organize my workshop. 
        Since there are several types of wood that can be learned to use, in this section we will show how to 
        use two of them. Hardwood will be the material we will use for our first project. The project that I will
        include will be how to make a meat chopping board.
        The first part will indicate what types of hardwood can be obtained and what are the basic dimensions 
        that must be met for the project. This is for starters, you can always include your own imagination as 
        long as you stick to the basic rules. They will then need to gather the necessary materials and tools 
        for this project. It will tell you what they are since although it is a simple project, specific materials
         are required to do it correctly. I will include a list.
        The second part of the project will be the preparation that will be divided into 8 steps with images 
        and texts.
        The third part will include the realization of the project in 8 steps, we will see how we have to finish.
        The second option is in melamine chipboard. This type of material is much easier to start and finish as 
        it requires fewer processes in its treatment. This means that since the material comes with a ready-made 
        finishing process, only cutting and finishing steps are required in the assembly, unlike rustic wood. 
        This project will be like making a nightstand and include a drawer. The project will be shown step by 
        step in this type of material.
        The first part will be to design and choose the color. I will include a link to design in a specialized 
        software the dimensioning of this material, the program is called Polyboard. The second part will include
        the breakdown of this project.
        The third part will include the preparation of the material before assembly. Then we will go to the 
        assembly and finally to the completion including optional details.

      <h3>Small-business solutions</h3>
      <p>
      This section will include hints and tips to help small businesses thrive. We may be the most competent 
      accountants, resume writers, or artisan bakers in the world, but your small business will eventually 
      suffer if it lacks business sense. Starting your own small business is an exercise in uncertainty, which 
      is why it's so important to learn from those who have been in your shoes. With the right guidance, you 
      will be successful in creating a unique business. You'll run into roadblocks that can threaten business 
      viability if you overlook critical administrative tasks like bookkeeping or maintaining high-quality 
      supplier relationships. In fact, the top reasons a new business fails include lacking a marketing strategy, 
      not having a plan for how to scale the business to meet growing demand, or offering a poorly conceived 
      product or service with a total addressable market (TAM). ) too small.
      Here we will learn financial and marketing tips, as well as tips to maintain a good relationship with 
      your employees.
