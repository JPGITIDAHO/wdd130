      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>Download and Print the Template
        Download, print, cut the template and separate the 2 pieces 
        to give your board the length you want.
      </p>
      
</div>  

<div class="proj2"> 
  <img class="step"  src="images/Cheese-Board_2.jpg"  alt="step-2" >     
    <h3>Step 2. Trace the Outline</h3>
      <p>Trace your template. I hope you can see our trace in the photo. 
        If your board has any stain or residue not identified as ours, 
        don't worry; can be sanded in the following steps. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Pencil marks will also disappear with a bit of sanding. Make your tracing dark 
        enough to see, but don't use feather or marker, as it can seep deeper 
        into the wood and will be difficult to sand away.
        </p> 
</div>
<div class="proj1">
<img class="step" src="images//Cheese-Board_3.jpg" alt="step-3" >
      <h3>Step 3. Cut the Wood with a Jigsaw</h3>
      <p>Time to hook up your jigsaw. Squeeze the trigger before the saw hits the wood.
         When cutting, always press down and make sure the metal base of the jig is flush 
         with the wood you are cutting.
      <p>
       Press hard into the wood as you cut. This will greatly reduce vibration, reduce 
       the impact on your hands, and allow for more precise cuts!
      </p>
</div>
<div class="proj2">   
  <img class="step"  src="images/Cheese-Board_4.jpg"  alt="step-4" >
    <h3>Step 4. Cut Curves in the Board</h3>
      <p>Cut in the wood. Look over the top of the jigsaw, watch the blade, and direct it.
        Stick as close to the lines you've drawn as possible, but if you're fighting with
        precision, bigger is always better because we can always sand later. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But don't overdo it and cut too much outside the lines or you'll be sanding 
        forever!
      </p>
</div>
     
<div class="proj1">
<img class="step"  src="images/Cheese-Board_5.jpg" alt="step-5"    >   
        <h3>Step 5. Cut the Other End of the Board</h3>
      <p>Cut the back of the board. If you can't get the 
        curvature you need to cut the concave part of the board. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Follow this trick: 
        Make a straight cut down the middle of the drawing and try 
        cut the 2 half circles on the sides, letting the wood fall to the side.
    </p>

<img class="step"  src="images/Cheese-Board_6.jpg" alt="step-6"  >     
    <h3>Step 6 Sand Surfaces</h3>
      <p>Sand the surface of the table with your sander, until it is smooth to the touch.
      </p>
      <p>Sand the corners and edges of the board, until you get a smooth finish, as if you had bought it.
      </p>
</div>  
<div class="proj1">   
<img class="step"  src="images/Cheese-Board_7.jpg" alt="step-7"  >     
    <h3>Step 7. Sand the Details by Hand</h3>
      <p>Sand down the details. Even if you use a power sander, it won't get into all the places, so it has
         to be combined with 120-grit sandpaper to get into the little crevices.
        </p>
   
</div>
<div class="proj2" >
<img class="step" src="images/Cheese-Board_8.jpg" alt="step-8" >      
    <h3>Step 8. Apply Food Grade Mineral Oil</h3>
      <p>Apply food grade mineral oil to the board. If you want it to penetrate deeply, rub it in with a cloth and repeat the process several times.
        Your project is finished!

    <h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Our recommendation if there are many cuts and very long is that you turn to a 
      professional or specialized company. Cutting melamine boards without splintering 
      is a job that requires the right tool, precision and power.
    </p>
    <P>
      If it is about small cuts in small pieces, the piece being fixed, and moving 
      the miter saw itself, it is feasible to achieve excellent results. The technique 
      is simple: we lower the saw decisively but not quickly, without raising it until
      we have finished the cut, have stopped the saw and have moved the piece away.
    </P>

<div class="proj1">

    <h3>Step 1. Exploded view for a Suspended Nightstand</h3>
      <p>The first thing is to make a design or structure of our project, 
        for this we can use the program specified in the link that will allow 
        us to carry out this step if we wish.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise you can take the specifications of the structure to 
        specialized places that have the machinery and infrastructure.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="proj2"> 
<img class="step" class="proj-2" src="images/mesilla-medidas-proyecto2.jpg" alt="STEP-2" >      
    <h3>Step 2.</h3>
      <p>Two bedside tables are obtained from a single standard size board of 244*122. 
        The dimensions of the pieces are specified taking into account the direction 
        of the grain (this is important if you are going to make the cuts by a third party). 
      </p>
      <p>  
        If you prefer to use a solid color, for example white, you do not need to pay 
        attention to the cutting direction.
      </p>
</div> 
<div class="proj1">   
<img class="step" class="proj-3" src="images/cortar-melamina-1.jpg" alt="STEP-3" >
      <h3>Step 3. Cover the edges of the melamine pieces. </h3>
      <p>We must take each piece, give it a label to write down its measurements and to know
        which part it is from our furniture. In this way we will also know which song to cover.
         We could mark all the edges to be covered with a pencil and then proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also many videos on how to glue glued and non-glued edgebanding
        </p>
</div>
<div class="proj2">
<img class="step" class="proj-4" src="images/broca.jpg" alt="STEP-4" >
      <h3>Step 4. Mark and drill.</h3>
      <p>To know where to drill, we can take another 18mm piece, place it on the piece to be 
        drilled and mark its thickness with a pencil. We will know at a glance where the other
         piece will go when it is placed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We must make another mark in the middle, 9mm from the 
         edge, where we will locate the screws (6*2).
          It is not necessary to drill holes in both pieces if the melamine is a chipboard base. 
          We only have to drill one. The first.
        </p>

<div class="proj1"> 
<img class="step" class="proj-5" src="images/mesilla-medidas-proyecto-2.jpg" alt="STEP-5" >      
        <h3>Step 5. Assembly of structure. </h3>
      <p>We will take the floor and join it with the sides and the bottom of the table. 
        The bottom of the table, we can also screw them to the sides. If we see the bedside 
        table from the side, we will see the side of the background.
      </p>
       <p>Then we will locate the middle shelf. It can be screwed onto the sides from the outside.
         If we do not want the screws to be seen, we can use plastic or metal squares that are 
         placed on the inside.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="proj2">  
<img class="step" class="proj-6" src="images/iStock-638412546.jpg" alt="STEP-6"  >    
    <h3>Step 6. Assembly of drawer.</h3>
      <p>We will join the sides, front and back of the drawers.
        The sides should always embrace the front and against the front.
        This will prevent the drawer from disarming when we pull the handle or handle.
      </p>
      <p>To install the telescopic slides you have to disassemble them.
        When placing sliders we will not use long 50 screws but we must use 4 * 15 screws so that 
        they do not pass the 18 mm melamine. To place them it is not necessary to drill holes.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="proj1">
<img class="step" class="proj-7" src="images/iStock-1292156297.jpg" alt="STEP-7"  >    
    <h3>Step 7. </h3>
      <p>Once the internal part of the slides is attached to the drawer, we must attach the other
        part to the structure. The drawer will go in the upper part, we must leave a light between 
        the structure of the drawer and the shelf.</p>
      <p>That will give us the distance where we must screw the other part of the slide.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="proj2">
<img class="step" class="step" class="proj-8" src="images/Light-table-2.jpg" alt="STEP-8"  >    
    <h3>Step-8. </h3>
      <p>To place the lid of our modern nightstand we must put the drawer in its place. We must 
        drill holes in the front of the drawer and then screw the lid from the inside.
      </p>
